## Simple Shape Drawing

Demonstration of the 3 fundamentals of OOP by drawing shapes.

Initially the project contains only:

* **Drawing** - a JFrame that displays the shapes on a Canvas object
* **MyCanvas** - a custom java.awt.Canvas for painting shapes
* **Main** - main class to create objects and show the JFrame

## To Do

1. Use encapsulation: define a Square and Circle class.
2. Apply encapsulation: have MyCanvas use the Square and Circle
3. Polymorphism: define a common interface or superclass for Square and Circle
4. Enable MyCanvas to draw any number of squares and circles
5. Extension: define your own shapes. Make the shapes more customizable: set the color and size.
